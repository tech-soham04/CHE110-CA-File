            An EV is a shortened acronym for an electric vehicle. EVs are vehicles that are either partially or fully powered on electric power. Electric vehicles have low running costs as they have less moving parts for maintaining and also very environmentally friendly as they use little or no fossil fuels (petrol or diesel).

          <p>Electric vehicles fall into three main categories:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Battery electric vehicles are powered by electricity stored in a battery pack.
            </li>
            <li>Plug-in hybrids combine a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and large rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>
              Fuel cell vehicles split electrons from hydrogen molecules to produce electricity to run the motor.
